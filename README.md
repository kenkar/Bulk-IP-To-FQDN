# Bulk-IP-To-FQDN
Powershell script for bulk nsklookup 

This is a rewrite of Dineshswpd's script (Bulk NsLookup.ps1). My intention was to make the script more automatic                     
so you can chose folder and text file when script is executed instead of editing the script                                          
for each text file and for each different location where tex file might be located
